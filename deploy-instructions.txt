MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Since the files are in the sandbox, you have TWO options:

OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Connect to GitHub
------------------------------------------
1. Go back from the upload page
2. In silentledger settings, look for "Git integration" or "Connect to Git"
3. Connect to repository: https://github.com/ashwinjyoti-ship-it/silentledger
4. Set production branch: main
5. Enable automatic deployments
6. Click "Deploy now" or "Retry deployment"

This is the BEST option - future updates will auto-deploy!

OPTION 2: Use Wrangler CLI from Sandbox
----------------------------------------
We can deploy directly from this sandbox using wrangler:

1. I'll need a Cloudflare API token
2. You can create one at: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
5. Copy the token
6. Provide it to me, and I'll deploy directly

OPTION 3: Manual File Upload
-----------------------------
If you really want to use the upload page:

1. Clone the repo on your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/ashwinjyoti-ship-it/silentledger.git
   
2. Navigate to the folder
   
3. Select these files/folders and drag to the upload box:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - app.js
   - storage.js
   - import.js
   - api-storage.js
   - functions/ (entire folder)
   - _headers
   - _redirects

4. Click "Save and deploy"

RECOMMENDED: Go with OPTION 1 (GitHub connection)
This is the standard way and will make future updates automatic!

Current files that need to be deployed are on the main branch at:
https://github.com/ashwinjyoti-ship-it/silentledger
