## How to Run Locally

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser (Simplest)

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. It will open in your default browser
4. Start adding holdings!

### Option 2: Use a Local Server (Recommended)

This prevents any CORS issues and simulates how it will work when deployed.

**If you have Python installed:**

```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd /path/to/Papa-Baby-Shares

# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**If you have Node.js installed:**

```bash
# Install a simple server globally (one-time)
npm install -g http-server

# Run in project folder
http-server -p 8000
```

**If you have PHP installed:**

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

## File Structure

## How It Works

1. **index.html** - Contains the form and the container for holding cards
2. **styles.css** - Minimalist design with monospace fonts, black/white theme
3. **storage.js** - Handles all data operations using browser's localStorage
4. **app.js** - Connects the UI to the storage layer, creates cards, handles clicks

## Understanding the Code

### Adding a Holding (Flow)

1. User fills out form and clicks "save holding"
2. `app.js` → `handleFormSubmit()` captures the form data
3. Calls `storage.js` → `addHolding()` to save data
4. `addHolding()` creates a holding object with unique ID and timestamps
5. Saves to localStorage as JSON
6. `app.js` refreshes the display
7. New card appears on screen

### Deleting a Holding (Flow)

1. User clicks "delete" button on a card
2. `app.js` → `handleDelete()` asks for confirmation
3. Calls `storage.js` → `deleteHolding(id)` to remove data
4. `deleteHolding()` filters out the holding from the array
5. Saves updated array to localStorage
6. `app.js` refreshes the display
7. Card disappears from screen

### Adding a Ledger Entry (Flow)

1. User clicks "add entry" button on a holding card
2. Modal opens with form (pre-filled with today's date)
3. User selects entry type (buy/sell/transfer/note/other)
4. User enters optional shares, price, and description
5. `app.js` → `handleLedgerEntrySubmit()` captures form data
6. Calls `storage.js` → `addLedgerEntry(holdingId, entryData)`
7. Entry is added to holding's `ledger_entries` array
8. Modal closes, display refreshes
9. Entry appears in holding's ledger (click "show" to view)

## Data Storage

All data is stored in your browser's localStorage under the key: `silentLedger_holdings`

**To view your data:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12 or Right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to "Application" or "Storage" tab
3. Click "Local Storage" → your domain
4. Find `silentLedger_holdings`

**To clear all data:**
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('silentLedger_holdings');
```

## Deployment
